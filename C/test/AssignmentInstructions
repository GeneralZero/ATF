Store in [...]/src/myselect/ 

Summary: Write a terminal I/O enabled program to help you select stuff
Use: for example ./my_select *.c
This will clear the terminal and display a list of all .c files found.
They should show up in columns.

If there is not enough room for all items, display "please enlarge the window"

Every time the window size changes, redisplay the items to accomodate to the new size.

The first item should be underlined.

Using the keyboard:
- space bar: Used to select/deselect
      If the item was not highlighted, this will highlight it, and move the underline to the next item. Wrapping around if necessary.
      If the item was already highlighted, remove the highlight and stay there

- ESC: restore everything and exit

- Enter: restore everything and print onto the standard output the list of all items that are currently highlighted (with a whitespace between each one)

- Up arrow: move to the previous item, wrap around if necessary (i.e. pressing up when on the first item will move the underline to the last item)

- Down arrow: move to the next item, wrap around if necessary

- Left arrow: move to the item on same row but previous column. If you are on the first column, jump to the first item. DO NOT wrap around.

- Right arrow: move to the item on the same row but next column. If you are on the last column, jump to the last item. DO NOT wrap around.

The other keys (including control-C) should have no effect.

Applications:
more `./my_select *.c`

The back-quotes will allow you to first select a group of c files. Their names will be send to the "more" command.
